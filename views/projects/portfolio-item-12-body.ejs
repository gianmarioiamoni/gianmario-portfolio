    <h3>Document Ingestion Pipeline & Vector Search</h3>
    <p>
        The platform implements a sophisticated <strong>document ingestion pipeline</strong> that transforms unstructured 
        PDFs into searchable vector embeddings. Documents are uploaded via drag-and-drop, stored in Supabase Storage, 
        and processed through a multi-step pipeline: text extraction, intelligent semantic chunking using LangChain's 
        RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter (900 character chunks with 150 character overlap to maintain context continuity), 
        embedding generation with OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model (1536 dimensions), and storage in PostgreSQL with 
        the pgvector extension. The vector database uses IVFFlat indexing for O(log n) approximate nearest neighbor search, 
        with cosine similarity scoring to find the most relevant document chunks for each query.
    </p>
    <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b400ab74-9fa9-4285-b0e8-b7678478143c" 
        class="portfolio-details__img" alt="Documents Management" 
    />

    <br />

    <h3>RAG Chat & Contextual Q&A</h3>
    <p>
        The <strong>RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chat</strong> enables users to ask natural language questions 
        and receive contextual answers based on their organization's documentation. The system embeds each query using the 
        same embedding model as ingestion (ensuring consistency), performs a vector similarity search to retrieve the top 6 
        most relevant document chunks (with a configurable similarity threshold of 0.75), constructs a context from retrieved 
        chunks, and uses GPT-4.1-mini to generate answers with specialized prompt engineering. Responses are streamed 
        token-by-token using NDJSON format for immediate user feedback. Each answer includes source attribution, showing 
        which specific documents and chunks informed the response. Conversation history is maintained within sessions, 
        allowing for contextual follow-up questions.
    </p>

    />

    <br />

    <h3>SOP Generation & Export</h3>
    <p>
        The platform can <strong>automatically generate Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)</strong> from company documentation 
        using specialized AI prompting. Users specify a title, scope, and context, and the system leverages the same RAG 
        infrastructure to retrieve relevant chunks, then uses GPT-4.1 (full model for complex reasoning) with a specialized 
        template to generate structured SOPs. The output includes: purpose and scope section, prerequisites checklist, 
        numbered step-by-step instructions, safety warnings and notes, and post-completion checklist. Generated SOPs can be 
        edited, regenerated, or exported to Markdown or PDF formats with custom formatting using pdf-lib.
    </p>

    <h3>Multi-Tenant Architecture & Security</h3>
    <p>
        Built with <strong>enterprise-grade security</strong> and true multi-tenancy using Supabase Row-Level Security (RLS). 
        Every database table has RLS policies that enforce organization-level data isolation at the database layer, ensuring 
        users can only access data belonging to their organization. The platform implements a 4-tier Role-Based Access Control 
        (RBAC) system: Viewer (read-only access), Contributor (can upload docs and generate SOPs), Company Admin (full team 
        management, billing, and user invitations), and Super Admin (platform oversight with access to all organizations, 
        system-wide statistics, and monitoring). Permissions are enforced at three levels: UI (hide features based on role), 
        API (server-side validation in route handlers), and Database (RLS policies with role column checks).
    </p>

    <br />

    <h3>Team Management & Invitations</h3>
    <p>
        Company Admins can <strong>manage their team</strong> through a comprehensive admin interface. The invitation system 
        allows sending email invitations with pre-assigned roles, tracking invitation status (pending, accepted, expired, revoked), 
        and automatically creating user accounts when invitations are accepted. Admins can change user roles, suspend or enable 
        users, view detailed user activity, and perform bulk operations like deleting all pending invitations. The system tracks 
        invitation expiration (7 days) and provides clear feedback on invitation status.
    </p>

    />

    <br />

    <h3>Super Admin Platform Monitoring</h3>
    <p>
        The <strong>Super Admin dashboard</strong> provides comprehensive platform oversight with real-time statistics and 
        analytics. Features include: total users, organizations, documents, conversations, and procedures; plan distribution 
        showing users across Trial, SMB, and Enterprise tiers; user growth visualization over the last 30 days; top 10 
        organizations ranked by activity (members, documents, chats, SOPs); engagement metrics (active users per day/week/month, 
        avg conversations per user, avg documents per organization); document ingestion status tracking; and time-series charts 
        for documents uploaded and chat activity over time. All data is filtered by organization using RLS, and Super Admins 
        have visibility across all tenants for monitoring and support purposes.

    <h3>AI Implementation & Performance</h3>
    <p>
        The platform's <strong>AI architecture</strong> is optimized for cost and performance. Document embeddings use 
        text-embedding-3-small ($0.02/1M tokens) for cost-effectiveness. RAG chat uses GPT-4.1-mini, which is 10x cheaper 
        than GPT-4 and sufficient for factual Q&A. SOP generation uses full GPT-4.1 for complex reasoning and structured 
        output generation. The vector search SQL function uses PostgreSQL's pgvector extension with the cosine distance 
        operator (<=>), indexed with IVFFlat for O(log n) search performance. Typical latencies: query embedding 50-100ms, 
        vector search 100-200ms, LLM first token 500-800ms, full answer 2-4s. Rate limiting prevents abuse (20 chat 
        queries/min per user), and streaming responses provide immediate user feedback with progressive rendering.
    </p>

    <br />

    <h3>Security & Compliance</h3>
    <p>
        Built with <strong>enterprise-grade security</strong> features including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Row-Level Security (RLS) in PostgreSQL for database-level multi-tenant data isolation</li>
        <li>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enforced at UI, API, and database layers</li>
        <li>Rate limiting with in-memory store for API protection against abuse</li>
        <li>Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options) for enhanced protection</li>
        <li>Input validation and sanitization with Zod schema validation for all API endpoints</li>
        <li>CSRF protection with secure token generation for form submissions</li>
        <li>Encrypted file storage in Supabase for sensitive documents</li>
        <li>Environment variable validation at startup with Zod schemas</li>
        <li>Error sanitization to prevent sensitive information leakage in production</li>
        <li>Multi-provider authentication (email/password and Google OAuth) via Supabase Auth</li>
        <li>Automatic session management with secure HTTP-only cookies</li>
        <li>Optional Sentry integration for error tracking and monitoring</li>
    </ul>

    <br />

    <h3>Code Quality & Architecture</h3>
    <p>
        The codebase follows <strong>SOLID principles</strong> and clean architecture patterns. Built with TypeScript in 
        strict mode (no implicit `any` allowed), functional programming patterns throughout (no classes), and React Server 
        Components (RSC) first architecture with minimal client-side JavaScript (60% CSR / 40% SSR ratio optimized after 
        thorough analysis). The project uses modular folder structure with clear separation of concerns: server-only utilities 
        in `lib/server/`, UI components in `components/`, internationalized routes in `app/[locale]/`, and database migrations 
        in `supabase/migrations/`. All environment variables are validated with Zod schemas at startup, ensuring fast-fail 
        behavior for misconfigurations. The codebase includes comprehensive JSDoc comments for complex functions and maintains 
        consistent naming conventions throughout.
