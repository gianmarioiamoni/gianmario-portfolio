    />

    <h3>Multi-Agent Orchestration & Workflow Engine</h3>
    <p>
        The platform leverages <strong>OpenAI function calling</strong> to create intelligent agents that can 
        autonomously select and execute tools based on context. Each agent has a specialized role (research, reporting, 
        email, operations) and can collaborate with other agents in sequential workflows. The workflow engine executes 
        agents step-by-step, passing output from one agent to the next, with comprehensive logging of each step, tool 
        call, and result. Users can create complex multi-step automations through the visual workflow builder, defining 
        agent sequences and monitoring execution in real-time.

    <h3>Workflow Builder & Execution</h3>
    <p>
        The <strong>visual workflow builder</strong> allows users to create complex multi-agent workflows with an intuitive 
        interface. Workflows are defined as sequences of agents, where each agent receives input from the previous step and 
        passes its output to the next. The system supports asynchronous execution for long-running workflows, with detailed 
        logging of each step, tool invocation, and result. The run viewer provides step-by-step visualization of executions, 
        showing tool calls, parameters, results, and execution times for complete transparency and debugging.

    />

    <br />

    <h3>Integrated Tools & Extensibility</h3>
    <p>
        The platform features a <strong>modular tool layer</strong> designed for extensibility. Integrated tools include 
        Web Search (via Tavily API), Email (SMTP or API providers like Resend), Google Calendar (with OAuth for reading 
        and creating events), and Database Operations (secure typed APIs, no raw SQL). Each tool is exposed to agents 
        through OpenAI function calling, allowing the LLM to intelligently select and execute tools based on context. 
        The tool layer is designed to be easily extensible, allowing new tools to be added without modifying core orchestration logic.

    <br />

    <h3>Subscription Management & Billing</h3>
    <p>
        Integrated <strong>Stripe subscription system</strong> with multiple plans (Trial, Basic €9.90/month, Premium €19.90/month) 
        supporting both monthly and yearly billing cycles. The platform includes automatic account disabling for expired subscriptions, 
        email notifications for expirations and deactivations, and a complete billing portal for subscription management. 
        Subscription status is verified at login and through automated cron jobs, ensuring users with expired subscriptions 
        are immediately disabled.

    <h3>Monitoring & Logging</h3>
    <p>
        Comprehensive <strong>structured logging system</strong> with categorized logs (auth, API, database, subscription, system) 
        stored in Supabase. The platform tracks security events (unauthorized access attempts, failed logins, CSRF mismatches), 
        performance metrics (execution times for agents and workflows), and detailed error tracking with stack traces. 
        Admins have access to system-wide monitoring and can track usage patterns, errors, and security events through 
        centralized logging.
